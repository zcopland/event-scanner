You can also check and see the full list of currently banned students.

# Use
### Action Selector
#### Check:
When an ID is checked, the program checks the number given to the banned list. If the ID is not banned, the background color of the page will turn green and text in the top left screen will confirm that the student is not banned. If the ID that was run, is banned, the background color will change to red and text on the screen will report that the student is banned.
#### Ban:
Type a students ID number into the text field, select the Ban option, and then hit GO to add them to the list of banned students. If the student is successfully banned, it will be displayed on the screen.
#### Unban:
If a student is on the banned list and they need to be removed, type their ID number into the text field and then select the Unban option and hit GO to remove them from the banned list. Text on the screen will confirm that the student is banned.

# Inspiration
This was inspired by the need to ban certain students from parties or events. This allows the hosts of a party or event to check a list and verify that the student is not someone who was kicked out previously for any reason. It would be very difficult to remember that student's name and/or face, so this takes the difficulty away and makes it easy to ban or unban students from specific parties and events.
